Hello! My name is Anjie Cao (Chinese:曹安洁; Pinyin: cáo ān jié). I am a third year Psychology Ph.D student at Stanford working with [Mike Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on understanding how people decide what to look at and when to stop looking throughout their developmental trajectory. Specifically, I study the looking time dynamics in looking time paradigms widely used in developmental psychology. I use a combination of computaional modeling and behavioral experiment. I am also interested in replication science and meta-science.

Before Stanford, I was an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied cognitive science and philosophy. My undergraduate research was primarily on language acquisition in infancy and early childhood. I worked in [Infant Language and Learning Lab (PI: Erik Thiessen)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/infant-language-learning-lab/Home.html) and [Infant Cognition Lab (PI: David Rakison)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/infant-cognition-lab/). I was born and raised in Beijing, China and I graduated from RDFZ in 2016. 

I believe that science should be open, accessible, and relevant to people outside academia. I am the author of a popular science book in Chinese, and the co-founder and host of the Stanford Psychology Podcast. You can learn more about my outreach work under the outreach tab. 

For a more complete record of my academic journey, here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C29Za2aFVL0hZpXiYe9Yx4CkA2S5cFbO/view?usp=sharing).
