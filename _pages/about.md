Hello! My name is Anjie Cao (Chinese:曹安洁; Pinyin: cáo ān jié). I am a second year Psychology Ph.D student at Stanford working with [Mike Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/). My current research focuses on using curiosity as a framework to understand looking behaviors in infants, preschoolers, and adults through behavioral experiments and computational modeling. I am also  interested in replication science. I am currently working on a research project that aims to test the replicability and generalizability of some classical findings in cultural psychology. 

Before Stanford, I was an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied cognitive science and philosophy. My undergraduate research was primarily on language acquisition in infancy and early childhood. I worked in [Infant Language and Learning Lab (PI: Erik Thiessen)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/infant-language-learning-lab/Home.html) and [Infant Cognition Lab (PI: David Rakison)](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/infant-cognition-lab/). I was born and riased in Beijing, China and I graduated from RDFZ in 2016.
