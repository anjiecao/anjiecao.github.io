cat!
----
- I adopted a cat in December 2020. Her name is Newell (aka Bonobo, aka Useless Bon Bon). She has been a wonderful and occasionally judgemental research assistant since then. A [picture of my cat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHeswVZVTnrU5hHRt5uaVOhGjR9hJTmc/view?usp=sharing) showing concerns for my literature review progress. 

books!
---- 
- My favorite genre right now is non-fictional. I occasionally use goodreads to keep track of the books I read. You can catch a glimpse of what I have been reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/sparklegoose).
- I was a literature type back in high school. Some of my favorite fictional writers are: Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera, and Konstantin Paustovsk.
 
music! 
----
- I adore indie rock and indie folk. Some of the artists I listen to are: Sparklehorse, Arcade Fire, Mitski, Phoebe Bridgers, Japanese Breakfast, Wilco, Bleachers, Belle and Sebastian, Bon Iver. 
- I wish I could also put my bandcamp link here but I can't because I don't have a band and neither can I play a band-relevant instrument. I played piano and hated it. 

food! 
----
- I am an adventurous eater and I would always prefer a dish that I have never heard of. 
- When I was at CMU, I made a [website](https://eattheworldpgh.github.io/map/) with an interactive map to display international restaurants in Pittsburgh. My project got featured on [Pittsburgh City Paper](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/eating-around-the-world-without-leaving-pittsburgh/Content?oid=15789763)!
